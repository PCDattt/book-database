# book-database
Using Mysql, Python to create, store and manage database.
Firstly, I use Mysql to create book database, which includes book, author, book_author, publisher, genre and book_genre tables. 
After that, I use python to build GUI and connect to Mysql to view and search books via title, pages, author, publisher and rating.
